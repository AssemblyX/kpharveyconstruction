Here is the breakdown of what I'll be doing in the next few weeks. Our goal is to create a new website with the ability to create a job and upload images connected to a job. Later we can expand on the futures like creating details and other features. We also talked about setting up social media.

Website
a) Edit template and Find images
b) Create proper Search Engin optimization 
c) Register with Google
d) Setup Digital Ocean server after website is completed
e) Contact current website admin and point domain to AssemblyX server
f) Organize video intro

Social Media
a) Set up accounts for Facebook, LinkedIn, Google and Twitter.
b) Create blog articles for 6 months in advanced 1 article per week.

If you have any questions or concerns please let me know ASAP.
