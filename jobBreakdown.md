# Breakdown for Estimate : #EST-20150212-1
Thank you for this opportunity and look forward to providing you services for a long time into the future.

Here is a breakdown to the Estimate provided. Please review closely and provide me with any additional information I may have missed.

## Web Hosting
`1 year` of web hosting starting on date of job completion.

In 10 months we will discuss hosting service fees for the following year. Depending on how the project evolves and the amount of work involved with maintain services will determine the new yearly cost. From past experiences with dynamic business sites having user log in sections you will be looking at roughly $500 a year. Again this is a rough estimate and I have work with sites that cost $1500 per month. Just giving you this information so you are aware and prepared for the future.

## Email Hosting
I do not foresee you needing more than 20 emails. If your company grows and requires more emails we will revisit this section of the contract after 1 year. In most cases the email is built into the monthly hosting package.

## Web site design
The site has already been designed and approved. I will maintain the same theme through out the site. There is still a small amount of design that is required for example buttons, forms and pictures added. This is built into the contract

Any additional medium or large design changes are not included in this contract. I do not foresee these type of design changes.

## Photo Upload
The photo upload section will allow you to upload images from a PC using a modern web browser. Once you log into the photo upload section you will have two options.
- create a project
- upload images for project

When creating a project you supply a password. Anyone who logs in using project name and password will have access to the images upload for that project.

## Drawing Upload
Drawing upload will have two main sections
- add contractor
- add drawings

In addition a sub-section will be added for assigning drawings to contractors. Once a contractor logs in they will see the drawings available to them.

Options will be as follows:
- ability to disable drawings
- ability to disable contractor

If a contractor logs in and no drawings are active they will have a screen explaining no drawings available and contact information if this needs to be addressed.

## MySQL Database
I have supplied a layout for the database and in time this will evolve as the application needs.

## Package Deal
All the above has been packaged as per the estimate. Please review and correspond any changes you feel needed.

# Important Notes

## Security
This website will not be on an SSH client. This means security will be very limited. This is a starting point for us and at this time security is not too important so to save on costs we will have simple log in access to files. People will require user name and password to access the site. If there are thousands of people accessing the site and we start having attacks on the site I will add more complex security but this is not built into the cost. Again this is nothing to be alarmed about at this time. My hosting company is very aware of such issues and at anytime this becomes a problem security can be upgraded 

Keep in mind that if your site needs to be upgraded it is because you have a lot of traffic. This usually means your site is generating revenue and the cost for upgrading the security is absorbed by the revenue. In other words, if we need more security you are making more money to offset the costs.

## Admin screens
All admin screens will be very basic. This will save on time and expenses. Since only a limited amount of people will be using the admin screens it will not be a issue.

## Your software is professional

All my software follows the <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/codeconvtoc-136057.html">Oracle Java Conventions</a> with added rules.

Code conventions are important for a number of reasons:
- Code conventions improve the readability of the software, allowing engineers to understand new code more quickly and thoroughly.
- 80% of the lifetime cost of a piece of software goes to maintenance.
- Hardly any software is maintained for its whole life by the original author.
- If you ship your source code as a product, you need to make sure it is as well packaged and clean as any other product you create. 

**You own all the work and files to your entire project including any future projects we do. If at anytime you decide to go with another programmer or programming company your transition will be easy.**
